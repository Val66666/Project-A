The race was on as Luca ran like he never had before. No one could blame him after the massacre. Every muscle burned as he swung his body forward, desperate to escape the horror chasing him. He burst up the stairs to his apartment and slammed the door shut behind him. Sliding down against it, his back pressed to the wood as his chest heaved for air. His mind replayed everything over and over, refusing to accept it. Was it really an accident?

“I killed them,” he thought, staring at his trembling hands as sweat rolled down his face. “I killed them all. I’m a murderer. If anyone finds out—jail. I’m going to jail. My life is over.” But the moment itself was fractured in his mind. He remembered the heat, the pressure, the screams—then nothing. Not the choice. Not the movement. Just a blur, as if something else had acted before he could think. He pulled his knees to his chest and grabbed his hair with both hands, his head bowed.

“What should I do? What should I do?”

Lost in his panic, Luca barely noticed the faint scent of cigarette smoke drifting through the room. Slowly, his head lifted. Someone was sitting on the single sofa near the window. The man lounged casually, a cigarette resting between his fingers as if he belonged there. He had dark brown skin, sharp brown eyes, and thick black dreadlocks, with a patch of stubble on his chin. A black beanie with pointy dog ears, two silver earrings glinting in one ear. He wore a white shirt with the collar open beneath a black leather jacket, black pants, and polished black Chelsea boots, one leg crossed over the other.
“You made a hell of a mess back there,” the man said calmly.

Luca sprang to his feet.

“What the hell—who are you, and what are you doing in my house?!”

“Relax, kid,” the man replied, taking a drag. “Don’t scream too loud. You’ll alert the neighbors.”

Heart pounding, Luca grabbed a knife from the dining table and pointed it at the stranger with both hands.

The man raised an eyebrow and grinned. “Cute. But you’ll need something better than that.”

“Who are you?” Luca demanded.

“Oh—where are my manners?” The man smirked. “Name’s Hendrix. And you are?”

Luca stayed silent.

Hendrix shrugged. “Suit yourself. Looks like the Devil Suit fits you nicely.”

Luca stiffened.

“…You know about this?”

“Of course I do. That suit was supposed to be delivered to me. Unfortunately, things didn’t go as planned.” He stood up from the couch and stretched. “Still, as long as it’s not in the hands of those ass-wipes, I’m fine with it. Now—let’s go.”

“What makes you think I’m going anywhere with you?” Luca said, stepping closer. “Get out of my house before things get messy.”

Hendrix laughed. In one smooth motion, he kicked the knife from Luca’s hands. It flew across the room and embedded itself in the wall.

“With that knife?” Hendrix scoffed. “You accidentally killed a few cockroaches and now you think you’re a big shot?” Hendrix continued laughing.

Luca clenched his fists.

“Listen, kid,” Hendrix continued, his tone sharpening. “Whether I leave or not, those JF bastards are coming for that suit.”

“The JF?” Luca asked. “Why would they be after me?”

“They weren’t. Not at first.” Hendrix exhaled smoke. “They were after a colleague of mine—Dr. Desem. The man you ran into yesterday.”

“Dr. Desem?” Luca whispered. “The guy who gave me the briefcase on the train?”

“Yup. Brilliant. Unstable. And now very dead. Since he’s out of the picture, you’re the next target.”

“Me?” Luca froze.

“Desem had something special—something the JF Force and the government searched for over eleven years.” Hendrix pointed at Luca’s chest. “That suit.”

“This suit?”

“The suit is powerful enough to wipe out an entire country. And it already has.” 

A strange warmth stirred beneath Luca’s skin. Not pain—something quieter. A pulse. He swallowed, suddenly aware of his own heartbeat, as if something inside him were listening.

Hendrix paused. “You remember the catastrophe eleven years ago?”

“The explosion?” Luca said. “Wasn’t that caused by an environmental disaster?”

“Nope,” Hendrix replied flatly. “The Devil Suit caused it. The government said that to cover up what really happened.”

“I have a couple of theories, but none of them truly explain their motives. Ah, crap—damn my mouth. I said too much again. Just forget about it,” he said, waving it off like he hadn’t just dropped a bomb.

“How can you expect someone to forget something this big?” Luca shouted.  “You basically dropped a cannonball and told me to ignore the splash!”

“Yeah… fair,” Hendrix said with a shrug. “Just—just don’t tell anyone, okay.”

Tell who, exactly? Luca thought. The walls? The pigeons?  The air?  Is the imaginary crowd apparently watching this conversation? Was this guy insane, or did he honestly think secrets worked on an honor system?

“Is… is this really true, Tho?” Luca said.

“What do I gain from lying?” Hendrix studied him, arms crossed. “You seem awfully interested. Lose someone back then?”

“No,” Luca said quickly—then faltered. “I’m just… curious.” He tilted his head up, eyes unfocused, like he was watching a dramatic flashback only he could see.

Hendrix followed his gaze.

“…Kid,” he said slowly, “what exactly are you staring at?”

“Nothing. Just thinking.”

“By staring at the ceiling?”

“…Yeah.”

Hendrix blinked. “You’re one weird kid, you know that.”

Luca looked away, embarrassed. “Just forget it. You won't understand.” “Whatever.” Hendrix sat back down. “We don’t have much time. After the mess you made, it won’t take long for them to figure out you’re the host.”

“How am I involved in any of this?!” Luca yelled.

“It’s simple. You’re wearing the suit. That makes you the host—the legal guardian of it.” Hendrix smirked. “Congratulations.”

“Wait—can’t I just give it to you?”

“Nope. You already signed the contract.”

“I didn’t sign anything!”

“Are you sure?” Hendrix’s eyes darkened. “Didn’t sign it… with your blood?”

Luca’s mind flashed back to the train—to Dr. Desem taking his blood. Realization hit him hard.

“That look says it all,” Hendrix said. “You did.”

“But I didn’t know!” Luca shouted. “I was just trying to help!”

“Yeah, sorry, kid,” Hendrix muttered. “My dead acquaintance was an idiot.”

“No… this can’t be happening.” Luca shook his head. “What if I take it off? Give it to you? Throw it away?”

“Won’t matter. Once the blood ritual was complete, the bond was sealed. No matter where you go, the suit will always come back.” Hendrix’s voice lowered. “The only way it detaches… is when you’re dead.”

“…When I’m dead,” Luca whispered.

For half a second, Luca felt something tighten inside his chest—almost like disappointment.

“Exactly.” Hendrix crushed his cigarette under his boot.

Luca felt numb—terrified, overwhelmed.

Hendrix stepped closer, staring him dead in the eye.

“Kid, they’re coming for you,” he said. “And for anyone connected to you. You could prevent that from happening.” He said with his voice low but firm.

Luca’s breath hitched as thoughts of his family flooded his mind.

“Listen kid, you’ve got two options,” Hendrix continued. “Come with me… or I’ll kill you and take the suit. Honestly? I’m hoping you choose the second. My hands have been itching. It’s been too long since they touched human flesh.”

There was silence in the room for a brief moment until a knock echoed through the apartment door.

“Luca, it’s Ms. K, please open up.” her voice called from outside, strained and uncertain.

“Don’t open it,” Hendrix said calmly, leaning back on the couch.

“What? Why?” Luca asked, already halfway to his feet.

“Just trust me.”

“It’s just my neighbor. She’s not a threat. I’ll see what she wants.”

As Luca was about to unlock the door, the sound came first—wood splitting with a sharp crack. He felt a sharp pain in his stomach. A blade pierced through the door, stabbing him in the gut. The blade was pushed in further, sinking deeper, tearing through flesh before being violently yanked back out.  Blood poured from the wound as Luca staggered back and collapsed, his hands shaking as he pressed them against the wound, clutching his stomach.
Hendrix was already moving. He rose smoothly, pulling a gun from beneath his black leather jacket. He fired two bullets through the door.

A scream—high, terrified—rang out, followed by a heavy thud as blood began to seep from under the door

“I’ll be back, kid," he said, flatly. "Just give me a minute.” 

A stranger lay slumped forward, half inside the apartment, his skull destroyed by the bullets. Behind him, pressed against the wall, was Ms. K—alive. Her eyes were wide with horror, her hands shaking as she covered her mouth, whispering Luca’s name under her breath. Hendrix took the ketana from the dead man, set it aside, and walked toward Ms. K. He bent down.

“Don’t worry, I’m not going to hurt you,” Hendrix said, placing a hand on her left cheek. 
Relief flickered across her face—just for a second.

“You’re not really of use to me.” He slid his hand to the top of her head, grabbing a fistful of her hair before he slammed her head against the wall, knocking her unconscious.

Hendrix straightened and raised his gun. He fired once into the wall outside her apartment. Then he took a few steps to the side and fired again. Another step—another shot. A door across the hall opened. A man stepped out. Hendrix shot him in the neck. Blood sprayed like a broken sprinkler as the body collapsed. Hendrix stepped into her apartment. All the JF Force agents inside were dead. Then he walked out and sniffed the air.

“There must be more downstairs. I can smell bloodlust.”

Outside, forty-armed JF agents surrounded the building. As Hendrix stepped out, every one of them drew their weapon, ready to strike. He didn’t flinch. Instead, he pulled out a cigarette, lit it with a flick of his lighter, and took a slow drag. Smoke curled from his lips as he scanned the crowd.

“I want to thank you all,” he said calmly, “for showing up to your own funeral. Since our Maker’s going to reject you for the sins you’re about to commit, do me a favor—save me the trouble and head straight to hell.”

Back inside, Luca, who was slumped on the floor trying to put pressure on his wound.

“My body’s getting cold… I’m losing a lot of blood. Is this how I go out?”

Everything began to blur as his vision dimmed.

“Am I… dying? It’s getting darker… and darker. I’m sorry, Mom, Dad… I’m about to leave you. Leo… I guess I’m coming sooner than expected.” He thought to himself

Just as he was losing consciousness, Luca felt a sharp twist in his stomach, like a boat crashing in a storm. He screamed in pain and opened his eyes to see Hendrix standing above him, covered in blood.

“What the hell are you doing, you idiot?! Get up! There’s no time to take a nap!” Hendrix barked.

“I’m not taking a nap… I’m dying,” Luca groaned.

“Doesn’t seem like it to me.”

“I just got stabbed—!” Luca stopped mid-sentence as realization struck. He looked down and saw that his abdomen was completely healed

“Wait… where’s the wound? The blood? What happened?” he asked

“Oh yeah, I forgot to mention—the devil suit heals your wounds.” Hendrix said casually

“You could’ve mentioned that earlier when I was stabbed?!” Luca shouted.

“You didn’t ask.” He shrugged.

“I didn’t ask?!” Luca yelled. “Sorry—I didn’t realize I was supposed to interview you while getting stabbed!”

“Communication in the interview is very important, you know.” Hendrix said.

Luca glared at him, barely resisting the urge to strangle him. Hendrix pulled out a cigarette, lit it, and took a slow drag as smoke curled from his lips.

“You still haven’t answered me, kid,” Hendrix said.

“I don’t really have a choice, do I?” Luca replied.

“You never had one to begin with—only to comply.” He sighed

“Fine. I’ll comply, but only if you agree to my conditions.”

“Negotiation is not an option.”

“I know. But it’s important.” Hendrix sighed. 

“Fine. What are the terms?”

“As you said, they’ll come after me—and anyone connected to me. My parents…” Luca swallowed hard, an image of his mother’s hands tightening around his chest. “Let’s get them first. Take them with us. After that, I’ll cooperate. Fully. Please. They’re all I have left.”

The word please lingered.

Hendrix stiffened.

For a brief moment, another voice echoed in his mind—another woman, saying the same thing.

He exhaled slowly. “Fine. You got yourself a deal, kid.”

“It’s Luca, by the way.”

“…What?”

“My name’s Luca.” 

Hendrix would nod

Outside the apartment, the front yard was a graveyard. Forty lifeless bodies lay scattered, their blood painting the pavement red. The air was thick with the stench of death. There was silence between them as Luca and Hendrix stepped out. 

“What the hell happened here, Hendrix?” he asked, shaken.

“Don’t worry about it. Death just showed up early for them. We’re still breathing, and that’s all that matters. Let’s move—before more show up.”

As Luca’s eyes swept across the twisted limbs and bloodied faces, his stomach churned, and without warning, he bent over and vomited. Luca wiped his mouth, the taste of bile still clinging to his throat. The silence was deafening. He looked up at Hendrix, who stood with that same unreadable expression, a cigarette between his lips like none of this mattered.

From a distance came the faint hum of a car engine idling near the now demolished apartment. Inside a black Mercedes-Maybach vehicle, a man sat silently. Dressed in a black tuxedo with two of the top buttons undone. He had a bald head marked by a healed scar on the right side of his forehead. His skin was fair, his eyes a pale blue-gray, and his dark, thick brows gave him a sharp, imposing look. The man pressed a finger to his ear. 

“The new host has awakened,” he said, his voice smooth and calm, as velvet stretched over a blade. A distorted voice crackled back through his coms. 

“Is he alone?” The man glanced out the window toward Luca’s building.

“No,” he replied. “He’s got someone capable with him. Orders?”

A beat of silence.

“Observe. Do not engage. Not yet, at least. Let the devil bloom,” the voice murmured. 

“And when it does... We’ll carve the truth from his flesh.”

“Understood.” The call ended. The man in the black Mercedes-Maybach car pressed a button, the windshield tinted over and he drove away.
