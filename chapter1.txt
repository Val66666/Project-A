Their footsteps were behind me. You could hear the rush they were in. I was way ahead. I did not want to look back because once I did, I knew it was over. With the briefcase in hand, I kept running, not knowing where to go. There was a wall ahead of me and I could not turn back. Not now. I was so close to the truth. I kept running even though it was pointless. I was doomed. 

Eleven years ago...

It was a normal day. Or at least that’s what I thought before it happened. Without warning, an explosion occurred, engulfing cities across countries worldwide. No one knew it would happen, and no one knew how. It just happened. Fires everywhere. Cars abandoned mid-street. Screams tore through the air—people begging for help, for mercy. I thought it was the end of the world. That might have been better. The government was nowhere to be found when it happened. We were left to fend for ourselves until our great heroes rescued us. They were known as the JF Force (Justices Federal Force). They provided us food and shelter, but mostly comfort in our time of need. They helped restore the counties. Our heroes. Or so we were told.


It never made sense to me that this one person was just ready with everything we needed after the explosion. And the government was just silent. No proper explanation or theories. Was it a terrorist attack? A military threat? A big scientific accident? We never knew. As soon as the 'JF force’ stepped in, we were not to think about it. Just focus on rebuilding our country. We’ve done our best with what we were given. It’s not better but not worse either. I don’t think our society will ever be the same. But I needed to know the truth. That explosion changed my life. My family, my friends. They were all taken away from me. After that day, I was left alone. I made it my mission to uncover the truth, even if it was the last thing I did.

~present day

They were just behind me. Even with their long black coats and gloves, I knew they were there. I’m sure they realized I wasn’t slowing down anytime soon, so they decided to pull out their guns. Now I was dodging bullets, which, in my opinion, was unfair. Still, I managed to outrun them and create a huge gap between us.

Suddenly, I felt a sharp pain in my ribs. I was hit, Pain flared white-hot in my ribs. I almost stumbled—but stopping wasn’t an option. Out of nowhere, a man on a black motorcycle appeared. He came straight for me, launching himself off the side of the train tracks, aiming to take me out. I ducked, rolled to the side, and swung my right arm, slamming the briefcase I was holding into his head. He hit the train track floor hard.

Without hesitation, I reached into my pants, pulled out my gun, and shot him in the eye. Blood poured out, but there wasn’t time to process. From a distance, I spotted a sniper lining up a shot. I raised the briefcase just as the sniper fired. The bullet smashed into it, the impact throwing me hard against the side of the train tracks. Pain erupted in my lower back and ribs, but I did not stop. The sniper was preparing to fire again. I forced myself up, dodged the next shot, and noticed a dark tunnel ahead. Without a second thought, I ran for it, desperate to escape.

I didn’t dare look back, which turned out to be a mistake. The roar of an engine and the flash of headlights told me I wasn’t alone. Another motorcycle was coming up fast behind me, this time carrying two riders. The riders opened fire, and I felt two bullets tear into me—one in my left arm, the other in my already aching ribs. The pain was unbearable, but I kept running. They were closing in, though, and I knew I couldn’t outrun them.

I stopped, turned, and fired back. My shots hit the motorcycle’s tire, spinning it out of control and throwing both riders to the ground. I did not waste a second. I shot one of them in the groin. His screams echoed through the tunnel as I yanked off his helmet and shot him directly in the mouth.

The other guy scrambled for his gun, but I fired at his leg, stopping him in his tracks. I marched up to him, kicked him hard in the head, slamming his face into the floor, then shot him in the ass for good measure. I ripped off his helmet and finished the job with two shots to the ear. Without looking back, I forced myself to keep running. My body screamed in pain, but I could not afford to stop.

I saw up ahead that it was a dead end, and I could not turn back now. I heard footsteps; they were getting closer. Looking around the dark tunnel, I saw a glimmer of silver. It looked like a doorknob. When I twisted the handle, it opened thankfully. I ran in, not even bothering to close it behind me. I could hear their footsteps echo in the narrow space. As I ran, it grew wider and wider. I turned a corner and celebrated internally at the sound of people nearby. I found myself in the crowded subway. The agents came up and noticed the crowd hiding their guns in their coats. I tried to blend in with the crowd, hiding my wounds with the briefcase and praying that a train would show up, and the Lord answered with an express train. I joined the crowd. Then I caught the agent’s eye. He whistled to his partner, and they started walking towards me. I was inside, but the doors were still open. Panic rose as they got closer and closer. Then they suddenly shut just as they reached the platform. They banged on the window, looking directly at me. I made an ‘L’ with my hand as the train began to move, leaving them behind. I went to the end of the train carriage where there were fewer passengers and sat down. At least I was safe. For now, anyway. The two agents cursed. They had lost him again. Looking around, they found the train schedules. Now they knew where he was headed, and they made a couple of calls to every dangerous assailant they knew. Now I was a wanted man.

At UJ High School, the world was quiet. In the chemistry class sat a quiet boy wearing a blue jersey, blue tie, white shirt, and gray pants uniform. His name was Luca Wilburn. Luca had a black, curly afro, brown skin, and bright brown eyes. Barely paying attention to the lecturer, he was zoned out, staring out of the window, taking notice of the rain clouds that were rolling in. Minutes later, the bell rang signaling it was time to go home. Luca snapped out of his thoughts and began packing his belongings, moving with practiced efficiency as students around him scraped chairs and filled the room with noise. 

“Hey, Luca,” a white boy called out. He has a youthful, slender face with a distinctively pointed nose, slightly messy dark brown hair that falls over his forehead, and dark brown eyes, and is wearing the same uniform as Luca. 

“Check what I got.” The boy stretched his arm out, holding something up in front of Luca’s face.

Luca slowly turned his attention to him. “What is this, Greg?” he asked, raising a brow.

“Two invitations to Chloe’s party. So—”

Luca turned back to packing his things. “Sorry, I can’t come,” he said flatly, showing no interest.

“You didn’t even let me finish. Plus—why?”

“I have stuff to do. And you know my parents don’t allow me to go out to those things.”

“Come on, Luca. Your parents are barely around, and this is the first time we’ve ever been invited to something like this.”

“Do you know how hard it was for me to get these?”

Luca paused. “Let me guess—did she hand out invitations without looking at who it was again?”

“No.”

Luca shot him a sideways glance.

“That happened last time,” Greg said quickly. “This time, she gave it to me personally.”

“You said it took you a lot of effort to get it. You didn’t say it was handed to you.”

“Well… I may have stretched the truth just a little,” Greg admitted. “But can you blame me? You never really want to do anything or even hang out. We could actually do something together for once.”

“Sorry, Greg. Maybe some other time.”

Luca finished packing and stepped past him.

Greg moved to block his path. “That’s what you always say.”

“Sorry,” Luca repeated, gently shoving him aside.

“You’re doing it again.”

“My bad, but I’ve got to get going,” Luca smirked as he walked away. “Oh—and be careful not to run into Rollen. I heard he’s in a bad mood. He and his gang beat up some kid earlier.”

“For real?” Greg asked, his expression shifting to fear.

Luca turned back and nodded once before facing forward again.

“Okay… thanks for the heads-up. See you tomorrow, then,” Greg said.

Luca waved goodbye as he walked off. Disappearing into the hallway.

Outside, the first drops of rain began to fall. Not wanting to deal with the weather, Luca decided to take the subway instead. As usual, it was loud and a bit crowded, not something he likes. Looking around, he noticed the two men dressed suspiciously in long coats. He paid them no mind as he walked onto the train, taking his usual seat at the end of the train car, which was usually less crowded. That was when he noticed a man lying on his side. The stranger had long blond hair that fell past his shoulders and a short, full beard framing his sharp, well-defined features. Thick eyebrows rested above light green eyes that looked tired yet alert. He wore a beige trench coat over a collared white shirt, the neckline slightly open. Luca sat opposite him, paying him no mind. He took out his phone to pass the time. The man let out a loud cough, but Luca paid no attention. It grew louder and louder until he started coughing up blood. Luca could not ignore it. Being a Good Samaritan, he offered to help, but the strange man quietly refused.

“Sir, are you okay? You look like you’re in pain. Let me help you,” Luca said as he took off his backpack and knelt on one knee toward him, placing his hand on his back to steady him.

“No. You can’t help me." He said, softly. "The damage has already been done.” he said, gently pulling out a pocketknife.

“There must be something I can do.” The strange man ignored him as he cut his wrist with the knife, using the blood to draw a weird symbol on the floor. Luca just kneeled there, confused by his actions.  He then began to speak another language that didn't belong to any language Luca knew and held out his hand.

“If you want to help me. He coughed once more. "Then give me your hand.” he asked. Luca was hesitant because in his head, the man was insane, but he obliged. The strange man held his hand and slowly cut his finger, then placed it in the center of the symbol. Luca felt a strange sensation in his body and quickly pulled his hand away. 

“What was that? What did you do?” he asked. The strange man looked towards him.

He then gave him the briefcase...

“Please take care of it.” he whispered. Then he collapsed.

“Sir? Sir?” he checked for a pulse, but there was none. He was gone. Frazzled, he backed away from the body, taking the briefcase and moving to the front of the train, making sure no one saw him. There was an announcement for all passengers to get off the train at the next stop. Luca’s anxiety rose. When the train reached the next stop, he quickly ran out, ignoring the large men in suits. As the train emptied, they began searching for the stranger. The driver, being of service, went to the back while the others searched the front. Looking around, he thought it was empty until he saw the lifeless body on the floor. He shrieked, drawing the others' attention. They saw the body and smirked.

“Alright. We got him.” one said. They led the distraught driver out as they went to deal with the body.

~Meanwhile

Luca was running back to his apartment, paying no attention to the rain. How could he? He had just watched a man die in front of him. He reached his flat, running up the stairs; his neighbor noticed him through her window as he rushed inside. Luca opens the front door, quickly running inside and shutting the door, breathing heavily. He put his back towards and door and slid down, replaying the events of the day. So lost in his thoughts, he didn’t hear knocking on his door.

“Luca? Are you okay? I saw you rush in here?” One of his neighbors asked, pulling him out of his thoughts.

“Oh yeah, yeah, I’m alright, Ms. K. Just a little tired is all.” he said.

“Okay, well, if you say so. Oh, and I made food for you. I wanted to thank you for helping with the boxes. 

He opens the door. Standing there was a mid-age white lady with a youthful look, defined facial features, long blond hair resting on her shoulders, and eyes blue as the ocean. She wore a gray sweater, a long brown dress, and slippers.

"It’s no problem and thank you." he said as he took the food. 

“My pleasure,” she said, smiling. “Also, I noticed you carrying a briefcase when you ran up here.”

“Oh, that,” Luca paused for a second. “It's for a school project. My friend lent it to me.” He hesitated, then added, “He asked me if I could design it for him.”

“Wow, Luca, I did not know that you could design.”

“Well,” he said, scratching the back of his head. I’m still a beginner. Not that skilled yet.” 

“I see. Well, at least I know who to go to if I ever need something designed.” She chuckled softly. “Well, I’ll see you later, Luca.” 

“Bye, Ms. K.”

Luca shut the door, set the food aside, and listened as her footsteps slowly faded and the door closed. He let out a shaky breath, pulled his knees up to his chest, and slowly rocked back and forth. He then paid close attention to the briefcases. He took the briefcase to his room. There was a corridor that led to his room and several other rooms. Before the corridor, the living room was on the left, and the kitchen was on the right. Immediately after entering the house, a single sofa was positioned near the window. To the left of the single sofa stood the dining table, and to the right was the same living room mentioned earlier. The single sofa sat between the living room and the dining area, subtly separating the two spaces. Luca entered his room, placed the suit on the desk, and opened it. To his surprise, it was a suit. The suit was a two-piece light sage green with a white shirt collar and a red necktie. He wondered what was so special about the suit that it was worth taking care of. Luca tried it on and went to his mirror stand to take a look. Then he felt the same strange sensation from earlier, and he grew weak; he held the wall for stability. Warm liquid hit the floor. Luca wiped his nose—blood. Then his ears. Then his hands. "What's going on with me?" he thought to himself. He coughed up blood, spilling it on the floor. A few times afterward, he felt dizzy and collapsed on the floor.

Back with the agents, they had now gathered some police officers to investigate the scene at the train station. A 6-foot-tall JF agent walked in wearing a dark green tie and a black fedora hat, going by the name Agent Silver. He wore round, orange-tinted sunglasses that obscured his eyes, had a brown skin tone, light facial stubble, and wore a white suit, matching his polished leather shoes with a bit of a gold design around them.

“Report,” Silver said.

An officer frowned. “Who are you?” he asked him.

“Gentlemen, please be careful about whom you speak,” said Agent Marco, a white male with a neat, blond mullet and sharp, darkish-blue eyes, wearing a dark green tie and a black suit. “He’s just like the rest of us, but he's an enforcer for the JF force.”

"An enforcer.” he froze. “I'm sorry sir, please forgive me. I didn’t know." the officer said as he bowed.

"It’s all right, just remove yourself from our sight," Marco said coldly. 

The officer left immediately.

Sliver tilted his head slightly. “That's a bit harsh, don't think.” He said, then waved it off. “Nevertheless—So, what does the report say?” asked Silver.

Marco straightened. “Apparently, the suspect Desem is dead, and the briefcase containing the devil suit is nowhere to be found. Marco said.

Silver’s expression didn’t change. “Did you check everywhere?” 

“Yes. Including the train station, he entered before this one." 

Sliver nodded once. “Then that confirms it.”

“Confirms what?” Marco asked.

“If it's not here or there, it means it's already with someone else.” Sliver said, “He was the one with it. before dying, he must have performed a blood relocation ritual.” Marco looked at him, confused. 

“So, you’re saying he passed it on?”

Silver didn’t answer. he began walking, scanning the train car slowly.

“Have they found any blood symbols?” he asked.


“Yes, there was one drawn at the end of the train carriage.” he answered. Silver went in to examine it. Seeing the now dried symbol on the floor, he studied it for a short moment. “That confirms it.” He said quietly, then walked out of the train back to Marco.

“Well, it seems that the suit has found a new host.”

“His intention?”

Sliver adjusted his gloves. “Desem was dying, and he needed a new vessel for the suit. I suspect he just gave it to anyone available at that time.”

“That is quite a bold conception. Care to explain?”

“Three words.” He said.” he was rushed. He was cornered, injured and about to die. So many errors, leaving him with no other option but to give a stranger.”

Marco smirked “Impressive.”

Tell me, have you checked the camera footage from before and after Desem's death?” he asked.

“Yes, we have, and Everything looked normal,” Marco answered.

“What about the passengers?” Sliver pressed. “Notice anyone acting odd after leaving the train?” 

“There was no suspicious behavior.”

“Hmm, alright.” Sliver turned. “I’d like to go to the surveillance room and take a look for myself.” Marco nodded, and they both went to the surveillance room. They sat in front of a screen showing footage from the train station exit, both sides of the train, and inside the driver’s compartment. They stared at the screen, watching the footage repeatedly.

“See, Commander. No suspicious passenger.” Marco said. Silver sighed and stood up, getting ready to leave before noticing something.

“Marco, can you give me a full-screen view of the train station exit?” he asked. After a few quick taps, they now looked at the exit. It was clear they could see the boy running out of the train. Unfortunately, his face was not clear enough to identify because of the crowd and the camera’s quality.

“Maybe he’s the host,” Silver said, pointing towards the screen. 


“That’s thin evidence. For all we know, he could have been rushing home like any other person.” Marco said. 

“True,” Sliver said. “But it was raining heavily at the time, so many passengers would have stayed at the station while others had umbrellas. But he didn’t.” He leaned closer to the screen. “He seemed to be in a rush, maybe because he was running away from someone.”

“Commander, we cannot assume—” 

“I know,” Sliver interrupted calmly. “A hunch isn’t proof.”

He straightened. “That's why we don’t stop here.”

Silver turned to Marco. "Marco"

"Yes." 

"Do passengers use a train card? Which ties all the personal details and information about them."

"Yes," Marco said. “And I am beginning to understand where you're going with this commander." Marco smirked. 

"Good, I guess you know what to do," with a Grim smile on his face.

"Yes, gathered information of every person on the 2 pm train and report back to you.
