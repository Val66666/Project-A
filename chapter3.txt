Heart pounding, without thinking, Luca zipped the bag shut, grabbed it, and rushed out of the classroom. Students turned to watch him sprint toward the boys’ restroom.

“Damn,” one student muttered. “Must be a big one if he’s running like that.”

“Yeah,” another chuckled.

Luca burst into the restroom and locked himself inside a stall. The boys’ restroom is lined with grey tiles on both the walls and the floor. Along the left side, six individual urinals are arranged in a single row, with six toilet stalls running parallel to them. On the right side, five connected sinks sit beneath a long mirror, directly opposite the urinals.

He locked it into place, louder than it should have been. Luca leaned his forehead against the metal door, breathing through his mouth. The air smelled of disinfectant and something sour beneath it. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, flickering just enough to make his head throb. He slid down onto the toilet seat, clutching the backpack to his chest like it might try to escape.

Don’t open it.

The thought repeated itself, over and over, like a warning sign he kept ignoring. His hands shook anyway. His fingers brushed the zipper, then pulled back. Outside the stall, someone laughed. Footsteps crossed the tiles. A toilet flushed. Normal sounds. Normal people.

Luca swallowed hard. If he stayed quiet, maybe they wouldn’t find him.

Maybe Rollen would get bored. Maybe today would end without getting worse.

The backpack felt heavier on his knees.

He touched his forehead, his chest, then each shoulder in sequence—fast, uneven. His breathing refused to slow. His skin prickled, like something underneath it was waking up.

"Just a suit," he told himself. "Just fabric."

But the fabric didn’t move on its own.

Minutes dragged by, stretching thin. Luca counted the cracks in the tile. Counted his breaths. Counted the seconds between footsteps.

Then—

“Luca… where are you?”

The voice sent a chill down his spine.

Rollen kicked open a nearby stall door with a grin.

“We know you’re in here,” another boy said.

“Someone told us, “A third added, kicking open another stall.

“Now come out,” Rollen taunted, slamming his foot against yet another door. “I’m not going to repeat myself.”

Luca swallowed. He knew he had no choice. Fighting back would only make it worse. Slowly, he stepped out of the stall. Rollen and his gang closed in immediately, shoving Luca backward until his shoulders hit the tiled wall.

“Well, look at that,” Rollen sneered. “You were late to our little meeting.”

“I-I’m sorry,” Luca said quickly. “I forgot—”

“Shut the fuck up!” Rollen shouted.

“We had games planned for you,” Rollen continued, smiling. “Beat you up first. Then maybe play hit the donkey—see what kind of food comes out of your mouth. Or use you for target practice with our water guns.” His friends laughed. “But since time’s short… We will skip straight to the beating.”

“Alright, boys,” Rollen said. “Teach him a lesson.”

They jumped him. Four against one. Luca never stood a chance. Fists slammed into his ribs. A knee caught his stomach. He hit the floor, curling in on himself as pain exploded through his body.

“Okay,” Rollen finally said. “That’s enough.”

The others yanked Luca upright, gripping his arms like he was a prisoner. As Rollen studied him, something caught his eye—something swinging from Luca’s neck.

“What’s this?” Rollen grabbed the necklace. 

“Give it back!” Luca yelled, struggling. “That’s not yours!”

“Shut up,” Rollen said, examining it. The necklace hung from a thin black cord, simple and unassuming. At its center rested a polished blue euclase gem.  “Looks cheap.”

The others nodded.

“Cheap things go where they belong,” Rollen smirked. “Down the toilet.”

“Rollen, please,” Luca cried. “My brother gave me that before he left. Please—”

Rollen let it slip from his fingers. It splashed into the toilet bowl.

“Whoops.”

“Rollen!” Luca shouted, fighting harder against their grip.

That’s when it happened. Then the zipper slid open on its own. Unseen by anyone else, the devil suit slithered out of the backpack like a living thing. As Rollen reached for the flush handle, the suit surged forward—wrapping itself around Luca’s arms, his torso, his legs.  Luca gasped as the suit tightened, his limbs locking in place. His body moved—but not by his command, with newfound strength. Luca tore free from their grasp and lunged, plunging his hand into the toilet just in time to snatch the necklace before it vanished. He turned slowly to Rollen. Luca’s eyes burned—not with anger, but terror.

“Stop,” Luca whispered—whether to Rollen or to himself, he didn’t know. The sleeve of his jacket fused into blackened flesh as the suit tightened around Rollen’s arm. Rollen screamed as the pressure crushed bone and muscle. forcing him to his knees

“Luca, stop!”

“Luca!” one of the boys shouted. “What are you doing?!”

“I—I don’t know what’s happening!” Luca cried, his arms trembling as he tried—and failed—to pull away.

But the suit didn’t listen. It 

Luca’s knees buckled. Tears burned his eyes as he pulled with everything he had.

“Please,” he begged. “Please… stop.” For a fraction of a second, the pressure eased. Then something inside the suit shifted. The pressure snapped back—harder. Then 

SNAP.
Rollen’s arm ripped free from its socket. He collapsed, screaming, clutching the bloody stump. The restroom fell silent—then one of the boys staggered backward, slipping on the blood pooling across the tiles.

“Rollen…?” he whispered, his voice breaking. “This isn’t funny anymore.”

Another shoved past him, panic flooding his face. “We gotta get out of here—NOW!”  

The gang turned to run. Too late. The suit fully consumed Luca, the fabric green sprouting razor-sharp tentacles. Inside, Luca screamed—his voice drowned beneath something older, colder, and hungrier. The tentacle lashed out like a snake hunting its prey, impaling every student. Blood sprayed across the restroom walls. Screams echoed—then stopped. Rollen, trembling on the floor, let out one final cry of pure fear. The screams were gone. No footsteps. No laughter. Just the hum of the flickering lights and the sound of something wet sliding down the wall. His stomach twisted. This wasn’t a dream. His breath came in sharp, shallow bursts as his eyes traced the room—blood smeared across the sinks, bodies crumpled in unnatural angles, Rollen’s glassy stare frozen in terror.

 “I—” Luca choked. “I didn’t—” His hands shook violently. He stumbled backward, hitting the stall door, sliding down until he sat on the cold tile floor. Minutes passed. Or seconds. He couldn’t tell. When the distant sound of footsteps echoed in the hallway, reality snapped back into place. That’s when Luca ran.
