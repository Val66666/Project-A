Looking around, he found himself back on the train. He saw the same stranger walking away. Luca stood up, trying to chase him. Then a dark force slowly surrounded him. When he looked around, the man was gone. The darkness crept closer and closer until it swallowed him whole. That’s when he woke up. He sat up and tried to catch his breath.
“It was just a dream,” he said, wiping away the sweat on his forehead. "It was just a silly dream,” he sighed, standing up slowly and walking toward the mirror. He saw some small dark markings on his face, then walked toward the curtain to open it. It was morning. He momentarily realized something, then walked back to the mirror.

"Huh?" he said, touching them. They felt just like his regular skin. Luca was filled with anxiety and concern. He noticed more on his neck and hurriedly unbuttoned his shirt. They were all over the place. Covering his arms and chest and moving down to his legs.

“What the heck are these?” he asked himself. He tried to scrape them off, but to no avail. He began to panic, thinking back to the man on the train. What if he had cursed him? Or if he were infected with some demonic disease? How would he hide this? He breathed as these thoughts quickened and circled his head. Closing his eyes, he tried to calm himself, counting backward from ten. He sighed and opened his eyes, looking around the room when he saw something disturbing. He saw himself sitting in his desk chair.

Looking at ‘himself’, he screamed, trying to scramble away from it, only to end up tripping on his own two feet and falling onto the floor. He stared at it, wondering whether or not he was still dreaming. The figure looked just like him, but his skin was pale, and its body was pitch black. It had dark circles around its eyes with shark-like teeth and short, sharp fingernails, like something from a nightmare. Luca closed his eyes for a split second, then his look-alike suddenly vanished. 

He breathed a sigh of relief and touched his hand to his forehead, upper chest, and both shoulders, giving thanks to the man above. "What was that?" he thought. Then he took off his suit and put it back into the briefcase before heading downstairs and outside the apartment building, where he threw the briefcase into the dumpster. He stood there for a moment, staring at it. If the briefcase was gone, maybe everything else would be, too. Whatever that suit was, it wasn’t his. He did not want it. Did not want what it was turning him into. Afterwards, Luca slowly returned to his apartment, then to his room, sat in his desk chair, and took out a journal from the desk drawer. He wrote down his thoughts and feelings, trying to relieve and calm himself after all that had occurred. Letting it out was his way of relaxing, scattering thoughts from the previous day, something he usually did. A few minutes passed, Luca snapped the journal shut and let it rest against his chest. The silence in the room felt louder than before, pressing in on him. He exhaled slowly, then reached for his phone on the desk.

Three missed notifications. All from Greg.

He hesitated before opening them.

Greg: Yo. You alive?

Greg: Did, you finish your homework?

Luca huffed out something that almost sounded like a laugh. Of course, Greg would text something like that. No good morning. No how are you? Just straight to existence checks. His fingers hovered over the screen. You wouldn’t believe me was the first thing he typed. He deleted it. Instead, he locked the phone. Whatever that thing had been—whatever he’d seen—it wasn’t something he could explain. The phone buzzed again. This time, it was a call.

Luca groaned softly but answered before he could talk himself out of it.

“Yo,” Greg’s voice crackled through the speaker. “You didn’t answer my text yesterday, and I waited like an idiot for your response. I needed help with trigonometry—that shit was hard you know.”

Luca forced a smile. “Yeah. Sorry. I was… tired.”

“You sound like crap.”

“Wow. Thanks.”

“No, I mean—Like, actually sick. Did you get food poisoning or something?

Luca shook his head. “I’m fine.”

"Are you sure?"

"Yes" Luca replied 

"Okay if you say so."

There was a pause. Just long enough.

“So,” Greg said, clearing his throat. “About Chloe’s party. You still not coming?”

Luca hesitated. “Still not interested.


"Why?" Greg asked, disappointed.

"I have stuff to do. And my parents are strict remember."

Greg's voice softened. “Yeah. I Remember.”

“Anyway," Luca said "You coming to school today?”

“Yeah,” Greg replied. “Probably. Depends on whether Rollen’s mood swings decide I’m today’s punching bag or tomorrow’s.”

Luca’s jaw tightened. “You shouldn’t joke about that.”

“I joke about everything,” Greg said. “It’s either that or cry.”

That earned a small, genuine laugh from Luca. The kind he hadn’t realized he needed.

“Anyway,” Greg continued, “meet you in math. I wanna copy your homework.”

“I didn’t do it.”

Greg gasped dramatically. “Luca didn't do his homework.  Wow. Who are you and what have you done with Luca?”

"Why are you so surprised? It's not like it's the first time I've missed homework."

"Yeah, but it's very rare". 

“Whatever, I’ll see you.”

“Yeah,” Greg said. “See you.”

Luca remained seated for a long moment, phone still in his hand. The call lingered in his mind longer than it should have. The reminder that just hours ago, before the train, before the suit, before the marks, life had been… normal. He stood and pulled on his school jacket, carefully adjusting the sleeves. As he reached for his backpack, he got ready for school.

Before leaving, hunger stirred in his stomach. He wandered into the kitchen to make breakfast, but felt too lazy to cook. He remembered the food Ms. K had prepared yesterday evening. He walked toward the front door, then stopped. The plate of food sat uncovered on the counter, cold and slightly congealed from being left out too long. His face tightened with disgust as he picked it up and dumped it into the bin. That was when he noticed a folded note on the counter—and beside it, another plate of food, neatly covered with a plate on top. He picked up the note and read it aloud:

"Luca, we’re sorry to leave you alone again, but your dad and I are attending an important business trip at the Atlantic Seaboard. We’ll be back in seven days. Stay safe."

Luca sighed. This wasn’t anything new. Since his parents worked for one of the city's largest companies, they were rarely around. Even from a young age, they have always been away on business. Though he was used to it, he still longed to spend time with them—whether for lunch or even just a simple phone call. He missed both his mother and father. Sighing again, he threw the note in the bin and ate his food. Soon after he grabbed his backpack and left the apartment, locking the door behind him with more force than necessary.

The hallway felt longer than usual. Every step echoed. Every passing neighbor made his heart jump. He kept his head down, resisting the urge to check his reflection in the darkened glass of the stairwell window. The last thing he needed was to see something else that wasn’t supposed to be there. Outside, the air was cold and damp, the sky a flat gray. Luca breathed in deeply, hoping the chill would ground him. Get through the day, he told himself. Just get through the day.

Luca arrived at school, reaching the school gates. Students clustered nearby, laughing, shoving, living like nothing in the world was wrong. Luca felt suddenly detached from them, like he was watching from behind the glass. Luca scanned the crowd instinctively, searching for a familiar messy head of hair or an exaggerated wave.

He spotted Greg near the bike racks, halfway through telling a story, probably lying to another student, hands moving wildly. For a split second, relief washed over him. Then a teacher called out, motioning Greg over. Greg rolled his eyes, shot Luca an apologetic shrug from across the courtyard, and jogged off in the opposite direction. Luca exhaled and adjusted his backpack straps.

That was when the laughter near the gate shifted in tone. Luca spotted a familiar group of students hanging around the front gate. There were four of them. He tried not to make eye contact, hoping to slip past unnoticed, but one of them spotted him and called out. Soon, the whole group walked toward him, surrounding him. At the center stood Rollen, the group's leader. He was tall and lean, with piercing blue eyes and long blond hair that fell past his shoulders. Around his neck, he wore a thin silver chain, and his wrists were adorned with multiple rings and bracelets that clinked together when he moved.

"Luca! How’s it been?” Rollen places his left arm around Luca’s shoulders. Luca knew better than to pull away. The last time he did, he couldn’t sit properly for a week. 

“What happened? I couldn’t find you yesterday. You have been avoiding me lately, haven’t you?" Rollen said with a smile.

"Of course not, Rollen,” Luca said quickly, avoiding Rollen's eye. “It was raining, so I had to leave early to catch the train. I didn’t want to get drenched, and my parents are strict when it comes to me coming home late, you know," Luca said, looking worried while smiling, awkwardly gripping his backpack tight.

"Sounds like he’s making excuses, Rollen," another boy commented.

"Yeah, maybe he didn’t want to get pummeled" added another.

Rollen chuckled, his arm tightening around Luca’s shoulders, cracking his knuckles—slowly. Practiced.

"I see, I see… but next time, Luca, don’t avoid me.” his smile widened sharply and humorlessly.” It hurts my feelings."

Before Luca could react, Rollen drove his fist into his gut. The impact sent Luca kneeling to the ground, clutching his stomach in pain. Rollen raised his fist for another punch—

“What's going on back there!”

A teacher’s voice rang out across the entrance. The group scattered immediately, Rollen stepping back as if nothing had happened.

A few students had already gathered nearby, their bodies blocking the teacher’s view. By the time he reached them, Rollen stood a step away, hands raised casually, his expression calm—almost bored.

“Class. Now,” the teacher ordered.

Rollen and his gang walked away, laughing quietly among themselves, leaving Luca on the ground, struggling to breathe. The teacher glanced at Luca, still hunched over, then back at the dispersing students. He hesitated—just for a moment—before turning away. 

“Luca, meet me at the usual place, and don’t be late,” Rollen called back over his shoulder.

Luca got up slowly, still clutching his stomach as he made his way to class.

He thought about saying something. About explaining. Then he imagined what would happen after school if he did. He stayed quiet. Meanwhile, a mysterious figure watches him from the shadows.

In class, Luca barely paid attention to the lecture, staring out the window as his mind replayed the events of yesterday at the train station and this morning’s encounter. He could not stop thinking about it—especially about the strange marks left by the suit and the blood he had lost, which had mysteriously vanished from his room. His gaze drifted outside, watching the birds through the window. They flew aimlessly in circles before falling into a single line. I wish I could have that, he thought.

His eyes shifted to the seat Greg usually occupied. Empty.  I wonder where he is. I hope he’s not in trouble.

The bell rang, snapping him out of his thoughts.

“Alright, everyone,” the teacher said. “Time’s up. Leave your math books on my desk before you go.”

Luca packed his things and opened his backpack to put his book away. He froze. Inside the bag—folded neatly—was the devil suit. His breath caught in his throat. His expression turns to fear.
